# e-Commerce Clothing Reviews

In this project, I'm going to analyze review data from an womens' e-commerce website. This analysis will be carried out in Python. I'll primarily utilize the Python wrangling library `pandas` and be doing any plotting in `matplotlib`. As simple `pip install ...` should do the trick if you don't have either of those. `Clothing Reviews - Data Wrangling & Exploration.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook that will showcase some of the visual findings and manipulations to the dataset prior to conducting the text analysis. 

 `Clothing Reviews - Text Analytics & NLP.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook of my `clothingrevs_analysis.py` py script. I will primarily use the `sklearn` and `nltk` libraries for the text analysis and once again, a simple `pip install ...` should do the trick. 
 
 Hope you enjoy and leave feedback!
